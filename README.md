# project-manager
Here will be development of project manager. It will allow to establish files more properly, ideally - without developer interaction

First main step - focus on Python projects from GitHub
- Gather several projects
- Define the dependencies-tree for files from the project
- From the tree structure define the proper folder "nestness"

Second main step - use predefined and common patterns
- look at the high-forked and common repositories and try to extract the common structures from them
